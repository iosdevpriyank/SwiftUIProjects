# SwiftUI Practice Project

This repository contains SwiftUI-based practice exercises that aim to explore various components, layouts, and interactions available in SwiftUI. It is designed for learning purposes and includes different examples showcasing the use of SwiftUI for iOS development.

## Project Focus

This project covers several key areas of SwiftUI development, providing hands-on practice with:

- **Building UI components:** Learn the basics of SwiftUI's building blocks like `Text`, `Image`, and `Stack` views such as `HStack`, `VStack`, `ZStack`, and use of modifiers for styling.
- **Layouts:** Experiment with different layouts and UI structures using tools like `GeometryReader`, `List`, `Grid`, and custom layout arrangements.
- **State Management:** Gain an understanding of SwiftUIâ€™s reactive data flow using property wrappers like `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@EnvironmentObject`.
- **Animations and Gestures:** Learn how to create fluid, dynamic UI interactions with `withAnimation`, `Animation`, and gesture recognition.
- **Custom Views:** Build reusable custom components and explore how to pass data to and from views using SwiftUI's declarative approach.
- **Data Handling:** Work with data-driven views, displaying dynamic content in lists and other components by working with data models.
- **Networking:** Simple demonstrations of fetching and displaying data from a REST API using `Combine` and `URLSession`, integrating networking into your SwiftUI apps.
